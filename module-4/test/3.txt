1 + 2 = 3
3 + 3 = 6
4 + 5 = 9
6 + 6 = 12
9 + 12 = 21

---------------
Third step
Sum the 2 youngest
4 + 5 = 9
1. Sum 9 to the global costs -> 9 + 9 = 18
2. Add 9 to PQ
the PQ now looks like this [6, 6, 9]

---------------
Fourth step
Sum the 2 youngest
6 + 6 = 12
1. Sum 12 to the global costs -> 18 + 12 = 30
2. Add 12 to PQ
the PQ now looks like this [9, 12]

---------------
Fifth step
Sum the 2 youngest
9 + 12 = 21
1. Sum 21 to the global costs -> 30 + 21 = 51
2. Add 21 to PQ
the PQ now looks like this [21]
